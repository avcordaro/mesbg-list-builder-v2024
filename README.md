## Helpful information

### PWA Installation

#### Desktop (PWA)

Desktop PWA installation is currently supported by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on Linux, Windows, macOS, and
Chromebooks. These browsers will show an install-badge (icon) in the URL bar, stating that the current site is
installable. This badge is located next to the bookmark badge.

#### Android (PWA)

On Android, PWA install prompts differ by device and browser. Users may see:

- Variations in the wording of the menu item for install such as Install or Add to Home Screen.
- Detailed installation dialogs.

If the website does not propt you to install the application you can forcefully install it using the chrome options.
Clicking the 3-dots at the top right and then selecting the "Add to home screen" option.

#### iOS (PWA)

A browser prompt to install your PWA doesn't exist On iOS and iPadOS. On these platforms PWAs are also known as home
screen web apps. These apps have to be added manually to the home screen via a browser share menu.

**The steps to add apps to the home screen are:**

1. Open the Share menu, available at the bottom or top of the browser.
2. Click **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Confirm the name of the app; the name is user-editable.
4. Click **Add**. On iOS and iPadOS, bookmarks to websites and PWAs look the same on the home screen.
