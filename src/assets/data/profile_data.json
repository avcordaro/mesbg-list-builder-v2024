Once that Hero and their Warband has been deployed, Grima's controlling player can deploy Grima as if he was also part of that Warband, following all the usual deployment rules. Grima is still part of his controlling player's Army, and will Activate like any other model in his controlling player's Army.\n\nIf Grima is deployed as part of the enemy Army, then enemy models treat him as a friendly model, and therefore cannot shoot him, Charge him, make Strikes against him, target him with special rules, or make a shooting attack in which Grima would be In The Way. They may also ignore his Control Zone. They can, however, target him with Magical Powers like any other enemy model.\n\nWhilst Grima is considered a friendly model, Grima may ignore the Control Zones of enemy models and may Move through enemy models as if they weren't there. When Grima Moves this way, he cannot end his Move overlapping or in base contact with an enemy model. Grima can choose to Charge an enemy model as normal if he wishes.\n\nThese restrictions immediately end if Saruman is slain, if Grima Charges an enemy model, if Grima destroys an enemy Siege Engine, or if Grima interacts with an Objective Marker (such as destroying a Supply Marker or picking up an objective), at which point Grima is treated as a normal enemy model and can be Charged, shot at and slain like any other model."

          "description": "A Siege Tower should be tall enough for the ramp to reach the battlements of the fortress when lowered and should be no more than 4\" wide across the ramp. Infantry models may be deployed within or on top of a Siege Tower, with the exception of Monster models. A Siege Tower can be pushed by friendly models, and will Move 6\" when they do so. It requires six Infantry models to push a Siege Tower, with an additional Infantry model required for each model in or on the Siege Tower. Monster models count as six models for the purpose of pushing a Siege Tower. To count as pushing a Siege Tower, a model must be in base contact with either the rear or side of the Siege Tower, or in base contact with another model that is pushing from the rear.\n\n\n\nIf a Siege Tower moves into base contact with the fortress in the Move Phase, then the ramp is immediately lowered. Models in the Siege Tower do not count as Moving whilst the Siege Tower is being pushed, unless they specifically Move within it.\n\n\n\nA Siege Tower can be shot at or attacked normally, has a Defence of 10 and 4 Wounds, and is a Battlefield Target. If a siege tower would be destroyed, all models in or on it will suffer Falling Damage."
