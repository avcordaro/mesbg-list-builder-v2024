Once that Hero and their Warband has been deployed, Grima's controlling player can deploy Grima as if he was also part of that Warband, following all the usual deployment rules. Grima is still part of his controlling player's Army, and will Activate like any other model in his controlling player's Army.\n\nIf Grima is deployed as part of the enemy Army, then enemy models treat him as a friendly model, and therefore cannot shoot him, Charge him, make Strikes against him, target him with special rules, or make a shooting attack in which Grima would be In The Way. They may also ignore his Control Zone. They can, however, target him with Magical Powers like any other enemy model.\n\nWhilst Grima is considered a friendly model, Grima may ignore the Control Zones of enemy models and may Move through enemy models as if they weren't there. When Grima Moves this way, he cannot end his Move overlapping or in base contact with an enemy model. Grima can choose to Charge an enemy model as normal if he wishes.\n\nThese restrictions immediately end if Saruman is slain, if Grima Charges an enemy model, if Grima destroys an enemy Siege Engine, or if Grima interacts with an Objective Marker (such as destroying a Supply Marker or picking up an objective), at which point Grima is treated as a normal enemy model and can be Charged, shot at and slain like any other model."

These cannot be deployed in the enemy's deployment zone, within 3\" of another Trap Marker or an Objective Marker, or within an enemy model's Control Zone. When an enemy model Moves within 1\" of a Trap Marker, they immediately stop Moving and flip the Trap Marker; after resolving its effects, the model's Activation immediately ends. Monster, War Beast, Swarm and Chariot models are completely unaffected by Trap Markers, and will instead simply remove them from play if they Move within 1\" of them. Once a Trap has been resolved and any affected models are no longer affected, remove that Trap Marker from play. The effects of each Trap Marker are explained below:\nTripwire Trap - When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 2 hit and is placed Prone. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\nPitfall Trap - When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap falls into the hole. Whilst in a hole, a model may not Move and always counts as Trapped. If a model begins its Move in a hole they must roll a D6; on a 4+, the model clambers out of the hole and their Move immediately ends. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\nSnare Trap - When this is revealed, Baldo's player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the trap suffers a Strength 1 hit, is placed Prone and is now caught in the Snare Trap. A model caught in a Snare Trap cannot Activate and will always count as Trapped. During the End Phase, a model caught in a Snare Trap must roll a D6; if the roll is equal to or less than their Strength, then they are freed from the Snare Trap. Cavalry models that reveal a trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also be Knocked Flying in addition to the other effects.\nDummy Trap - When this is revealed, the Activation of the model that revealed the Trap Marker immediately ends.
